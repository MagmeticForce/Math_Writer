# Math_Writer

Welcome to the Math Writer software!

This software alleviates the struggle of manually handwriting every single math symbol.. Similarly to how you can type text in a text document instead of handwriting it with pencil and paper, this Math Writer software allows you to type out your math work instead of having to handwrite it.

IMPORTANT: this program does not have Save or Load functionality. It is recommended that you take pictures of your work instead. 

KEYBOARD CONTROLS:
* TOP ROW:
    * ` is theta
    * 1 is 1
    * 2 is 2
    * 3 is 3
    * 4 is 4
    * 5 is 5
    * 6 is 6

    *  Backspace = Erase
* SECOND ROW:
    * Tab switches between Small Mode and Normal Mode
    * Q is +
    * W is -
    * E is *
    * R is /
    * T is =
    * Y is y
    * U is full square root
    * I is incomplete square root
    * O is square root corner (use it with the incoplete square root, the bottom horizontal line, and          if needed, the right-hand vertical line)
* THIRD ROW
    * A is bottom horizontal line
    * S is middle horizontal line
    * D is top horizontal line
    * F is arrow
    * G is not equals
    * H is greater than
    * J is greater than or equals to
    * K is less than
    * L is less than or equal to
    * ; is summation
* FOURTH ROW
    * Z is percent
    * X is x
    * C is vertical line left-hand side
    * V is vertical line middle
    * B is vertical line right-hand side
    * N is infinity
    * M is integral
    * , is ,
    * . is .
    * Shift is Shift. Use it to do "Shift + Arrows" to pan/scroll, or use it while in Regular                  Keyboard Mode.
* BOTTOM ROW
    * Alt switches to Regular Keyboard Mode, where you can type letters instead of placing math symbols.       You can also place symbols such as !, @, #, etc in this mode too just like you would if you were         typing like usual.
    * Arrow keys move the cursor. Use "Shift + Arrow Keys" to scroll/pan
 
Pleas note that the following keyys are not supported in Regular keyboard Mode:
* tilda (`) or wavy dash (~)

 Using this software may be a bit slow at first since you must get familiar with the keys. However, it's much better than handwriting every symbol (sine you can place a symbol with just the press of a keyboard button), and in addition, you will become fastr and faster at using this program the more you use it.
